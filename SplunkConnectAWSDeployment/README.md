# Splunk CCA Data Sources Deployment for AWS
The Splunk App for Amazon Connect uses a variety of data sources to help gain insight into your contact center performance both historically and in real-time. In standard Splunk fashion, data is democratized so from DevOps and AppDev teams, to Network and Service Operations Centers, to Contact Center Operations, to Engineering and Capacity Management, thereâ€™s something in the app for everyone. Key features include:

    1. Call trace record (CTR) correlation
    2. Agent status
    3. Agent performance
    4. Queue statistics
    5. Instance performance
    6. Capacity management visibility
    7. Bidirectional sentiment analysis via Amazon Contact Lens

This Cloudformation Template deploys all the required resouces and configuration to send the above data to Splunk using Firehose and HTTP Event Collector (HEC) token as shown below:
